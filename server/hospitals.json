    "about": "Bahawal Victoria Hospital is a hospital located in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. It is named after Nawab of Bahawalpur's British wife, Victoria. It started as a Civil Hospital with an outdoor department, a dispensary, and an operating theatre in 1876. In 1906, this health unit was named Bahawal Victoria Hospital.[2] Now, it is a hub of clinical expertise both in specialties as well as in sub-specialties with a multitude of patients visiting the hospital. In 1952, a benevolent extension of Nursing School was brought about with an anticipation to render rash and prompt basic health amenities. Classes leading to L.S.M.F were also started in 1956.[3][4][5][6] Its nexus with Quaid e Azam Medical College (QAMC) in 1970 has transformed it into one of the largest tertiary care facilities in the province of Punjab. It is now a 2200-bed, fully equipped, tertiary-care hospital with all medical and surgical specialities, serving large number of patients in south Punjab.[7][8] It facilitates undergraduate medical students of Quaid-e-Azam Medical College, nursing students of allied nursing school, paramedics and many post-graduate trainees.",
